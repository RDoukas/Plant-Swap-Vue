          Chicago Plant Swapp is an app that connects plant lovers across the
          Chicagoland area. All plants are by donation and there is no charge
          for plants.
        </p>
        <p>
          After having an overflowing collection of plants we decided what
          better than to share them with other plant lovers who we know will
          love our babies! You can swap anything from fully potted plants to
          propogations to even seeds!
