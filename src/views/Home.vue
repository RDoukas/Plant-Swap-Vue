            Chicago Plant Swapp is an app that connects plant lovers across the
            Chicagoland area. All plants are by donation and there is no charge
            for plants.
          </p>

            After having an overflowing collection of plants we decided what
            better than to share them with other plant lovers who we know will
            love our babies! You can swap anything from fully potted plants to
            propogations to evenseeds!
