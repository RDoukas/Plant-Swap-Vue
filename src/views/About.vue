      <h1>A little about us:</h1>

      <p>
        Chicago Plant Swapp is an app that connects plant lovers across the
        Chicagoland area. All plants are by donation and there is no charge for
        plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        After having an overflowing collection of plants we decided what better
        than to share them with other plant lovers who we know will love our
        babies! You can swap anything from fully potted plants to propogations
        to even seeds!
